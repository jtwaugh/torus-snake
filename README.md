# torus-snake
Snake game on manifolds.

When you eat food, the game randomly chooses an edge and assigns it to be either straight-glued to its opposite edge, twist-glued to its opposite edge, or compactified into a point. This allows the game space to change between a torus, a sphere, and a Klein bottle.
